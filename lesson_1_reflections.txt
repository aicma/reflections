it was quick, but when you know code
you dont think about the changes in 
the content that wont produce bugs

having easy access to older verisons
takes away fear of changing the code

Pro:
logical and hopefully functional versions
no useless clutter

Cons:
danger of forgetting

Docs main purpose is not to track your projects, 
its more to share with friends and 
access from anywhere

git log:
view the log of the entire reppo

git diff:
find difference between two commits

i wont have to find the error myself
or git helps me find changes i made 
and i can easily revert them


Study, asshole
