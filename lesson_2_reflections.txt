init sets up a new, empty repository in the
folder youre in.
Whitout the init, you cant commit

the staging area is like a stepstone from the working
directory to the repo.
the files in this area are going to be commited 
with the next commit
if there a files in my working directory which i dont want
to add to the repo.
if i made a change affecting multiple files, i can bundle them
into one logical commit

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
collect all files i changed in order to get a result
in the staging area and then commit them
