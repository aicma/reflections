init sets up a new, empty repository in the
folder youre in.
Whitout the init, you cant commit

the staging area is like a stepstone from the working
directory to the repo.
the files in this area are going to be commited 
with the next commit
if there a files in my working directory which i dont want
to add to the repo.
if i made a change affecting multiple files, i can bundle them
into one logical commit
